# Predicting House Prices using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for predicting house prices using machine learning. The model is built using a regression algorithm and trained on a dataset consisting of various features related to houses.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone: "https://github.com/kanihakaniha3/house-price-prediction.git"
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd repository
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format and contains all the necessary features for the prediction.

2. Set the file path: Update the `data_path` variable in the `main.py` file to the path of your dataset.

3. Run the script:

```
python main.py
```

The script will train the model on the provided dataset and output the predicted house prices.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code as per your requirements. You can modify the machine learning algorithm, add or remove features, or change the hyperparameters of the model.

## Data Description

The Boston Housing Dataset contains information about different houses in Boston, Massachusetts. It includes various attributes or features about each house like the number of rooms (RM), crime rate per capita (CRIM), geographic location (LON, LAT), median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars (MEDV), and many more. Each data point in the dataset represents a house, and the corresponding target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (house price).

## Training
